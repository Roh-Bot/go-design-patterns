//Input: s = "abcabcbb"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "bbbbb"
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: s = "pwwkew"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
//Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

// Pattern: Sliding Window + HashSet
// Approach:
// - Use two pointers (left, i) to represent a sliding window.
// - Expand window by moving i, shrink window from left if duplicate is found.
// - Track characters in the window using a set (map[byte]struct{}).
// - Update the maximum window size as we go.
// Complexity: O(n) time, O(min(n, charset)) space.
